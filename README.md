## 📻 News
2024.5.22： Our coder Henry had a meeting with Database group and brought contributive ideas to the interface spacification documents. Together with some changes from Web group, we update the [Interface Specification v.7.1](https://github.com/zhouyuheng2003/DSD2024-rock-house/blob/main/Project%20Document/interface%20specification%20v.7.1.md)

2024.5.20： We have made a visualization of the Recommendation and Feedback process with a [data flow graph](https://github.com/zhouyuheng2003/DSD2024-rock-house/blob/main/Project%20Document/Data%20Flow%20Graph.png).

2024.5.15： Now we are entering the second iteration for SA. We update the [Interface Specification v.7.0](https://github.com/zhouyuheng2003/DSD2024-rock-house/blob/main/Project%20Document/interface%20specification%20v.7.0.md) with WIFI function.

2024.4.26: It's a pitty that we are still updating the  [Interface Specification v.6.4](https://github.com/zhouyuheng2003/DSD2024-rock-house/blob/main/Project%20Document/interface%20specification%20v.6.4.md). We are trying to make the minimum change and notify the relevant groups with each updates.
1. In Feedback2Item and Feeback2Store, the "Item" and "Store" have been changed to "ItemId" and "StoreId".
2. The interface 5 and interface 11 will be first called by front end and then be responded by the database.
3. All the InterfaceId and CurrentUser from Web part have been removed.

2024.4.24：We update the [Interface Specification v.6.3](https://github.com/zhouyuheng2003/DSD2024-rock-house/blob/main/Project%20Document/interface%20specification%20v.6.3.md). Hopefully this could be the final one(for the first iteration):
1. Unpacking the encapsulated data interfaces of Web.
2. Update the "Interests" items.


2024.4.24：[Our Gantt Diagram](//github.com/zhouyuheng2003/DSD2024-rock-house/blob/main/Group%20Document/gantt.png) is ready. Later than expected by quite a bit though.

2024.4.24：Latest update of Interface Specification from v.5 to v.6.2:
  1. Add the 'VisitTime' to HuntedList.
  2. Add Algorithm interfaces to deal with feedback.
  3. Specify the two kind of feedback:

    (1) Feedback2Store is used to give feedback to the recommendation results (a store) and helps optimize recommendation algorithm.
    (2) Feedback2Item is used to give feedback to the purchased item and helps stores to offer better service.
  4. Update the description of the algorithm group.
  5. The web group modified some interfaces and added description.
  6. The interests have been changed from integer array to string.
  7. The interface one return an additional "interests".
